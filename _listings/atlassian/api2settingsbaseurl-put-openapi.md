      summary: Set dashboard item property
      description: "Sets the value of a dashboard item property. Use this resource
        in apps to store custom data against a dashboard item.  \n  \nA dashboard
        item enables an app to add user-specific information to a user dashboard.
        Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their
        dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing
        gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).  \n  \nWhen an app creates
        a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard item ID.
        The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable,
        the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store the item's
        content or configuration details. For more information on working with dashboard
        items, see [Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/)
        and the [Dashboard Item](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/dashboard-item/)
        documentation.  \n  \nThere is no resource to set or get dashboard items.
        \ \n  \n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:**
        Permission to access Jira. However, to set a dashboard item property the user
        must be the owner of the dashboard. Note, users with the _Administer Jira_
        [global permission](href=) are considered owners of the System dashboard.
        \ \n  \nThe value of the request body must be a [valid](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627),
        non-empty JSON blob. The maximum length is 32768 bytes."
