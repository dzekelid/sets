  title: AWS Route 53 API List Resource Record Sets
  version: 1.0.0
  description: 'Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.            ListResourceRecordSets
    returns up to 100 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning at
    a position specified by the name and type elements. The action sorts results first
    by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example:            com.example.www.         Note
    the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.When multiple
    records have the same DNS name, the action sorts results by the record type.You
    can use the name and type elements to adjust the beginning position of the list
    of resource record sets returned:If you do not specify Name or TypeThe results
    begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.If you
    specify Name but not TypeThe results begin with the first resource record set
    in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name.If you specify Type but
    not NameAmazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.If you specify both Name
    and TypeThe results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose
    name is greater than or equal to Name, and whose type is greater than or equal
    to Type.This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes
    records that are PENDING, and that are not yet available on all Amazon Route 53
    DNS servers.To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record
    sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets
    request while you''re paging through the results of a ListResourceRecordSets request.
    If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes while other
    pages display results with the latest changes.'

      description: To retrieve a list of your reusable delegation sets, send a GET
        request tothe /2013-04-01/delegationset resource. The response to this request
        includes aDelegationSets element with zero, one, or multiple DelegationSetchild
        elements. By default, the list of delegation sets is displayed on a single
        page. You cancontrol the length of the page that is displayed by using the
        MaxItems parameter.You can use the Marker parameter to control the delegation
        set that the listbegins with. Note Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100
        items. If you set MaxItems to a value greater than100, Amazon Route 53 returns
        only the first 100.

      summary: Create Health Check
      description: Creates a new health check.To create a new health check, send a
        POST request to the/2013-04-01/healthcheck resource. The request body must
        include a documentwith a CreateHealthCheckRequest element. The response returns
        theCreateHealthCheckResponse element, containing the health check ID specifiedwhen
        adding health check to a resource record set. For information about adding
        health checksto resource record sets, see ResourceRecordSet:HealthCheckId
        in ChangeResourceRecordSets. If you are registering EC2 instances with an
        Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) loadbalancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health
        checks for the EC2 instances. When you register anEC2 instance with a load
        balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, whichperforms a
        similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.You can associate health
        checks with failover resource record sets in a private hostedzone. Note the
        following:Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
        health of an endpointwithin a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
        IP address to the instance in theVPC.You can configure a health checker to
        check the health of an external resource thatthe instance relies on, such
        as a database server.You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm
        with the metric, and then create ahealth check that is based on the state
        of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatchmetric that checks
        the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add analarm to the
        metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of thealarm.
        For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the
        CloudWatch console,see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
